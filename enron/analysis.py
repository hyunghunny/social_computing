# What are some of these messages about, based on what the content bodies say?
# What was the maximum number of recipients on a message? (And what was the message about?)
# Which two people exchanged the most messages? (And what were they talking about?)
# How many messages were person-to-person messages? 
# (Single sender to single receiver or single sender to a few receivers would
# probably imply a more substantive dialogue than “email blasts”
# containing company announcements and such things.)
# How many messages were in the longest reply chain? (And what was it about?)
